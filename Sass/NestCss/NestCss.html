////Nest CSS with Sass
Sass allows nesting of CSS rules, which is a useful way of organizing a style sheet.
Normally, each element is targeted on a different line to style it, like so:
nav {
    background-color: red;
}
nav ul {
    list-style: none;
}
nav ul li {
    display: inline-block;
}
For a larget project, the CSS file wil have many lines and rules. This is where nesting can be help
organize your code by placing child style rules within the respective parent elements:
nav {
    background-color: red;
    ul {
        list-style: none;
        li {
            display: inline-block;
        }
    }
}

Use the nesting technique shown above to re-organize the CSS rules for both children of .blog-post element.
For testing purposes, the h1 should come before the p element.
