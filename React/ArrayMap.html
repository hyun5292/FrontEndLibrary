////Use Array.map() to Dynamically Render Elements
Conditional rendering is useful, but you may need your components to render an unknown number of elements.
Often in reactive programming, a programmer has no way to know what the state of an application is until
runtime, because so much depends on a user's interaction with that program. Programmers need to write their
code to correctly handle that unknown state ahead of time. Using Array.map() in React illustrates this concept.

For example, you create a simple "To Do List" app. As the programmer, you have no way of knowing how many
times a user might have on their list. You need to set up your component to dynamically render the correct
number of list elements log before someone using the program decides that today is laundry day.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The code editor has most of the MyToDoList component set up. Some of this code should look familiar if you
completed the controlled form challenge. You'll notice a textarea and a button, alog with a couple of methods
that track their states, but nothing is rendered to the page yet.
