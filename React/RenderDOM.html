////Render a Class Component to the DOM
You may remember using the ReactDOM API in an earlier challenge to render JSX elements to the DOM. The process
for rendering JSX elements to the DOM. The process for rendering React componenets will look very similar. 
The past few challenges focused on components and composition, so the rendering was done for you behind the
scenes. However, none of the React code you write will render to the DOM without making a call to the
ReactDOM API.

Here's a refresher on the syntax:
ReactDOM.render(componentToRender, targetNode). The first argument is the React componenet that you want
to render. The second argument is the DOM node that you want to render that component within.

React components are passed into ReactDOM.render() a little differently than JSX elements. For JSX elements,
you pass in the name of the element that you want to render. However, for React components, you need to use
the same syntax as if you were rendering a nested components, for example ReactDOM.render(<ComponentToRender />,
targetNode). You use this syntax for both ES6 class components and functional components.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Both the Fruits and Vegetables components are defined for you behind the scenes. Render both components
as children of the TypesOfFood component, then render TypesOfFood to the DOM. There is a div with 
id='challenge-node' available for you to use.
