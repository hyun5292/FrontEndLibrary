////Render React on the Server with renderToString
So far, you have been rendering React components on the client. Normally, this is what you will always do.
However, there are some use cases where it makes sense to render a React component on the server. Since
React is a JavaScript view library and you can run JavaScript on the server with Node, this is possible.
In fact, React provides a renderToString() method you can use for this purpose.

There are two key reasons why rendering on the server may be used in a real world app. First, without doing
this, your React apps would consist of a relatively empty HTML file and a large bundle of JavaScript when
it's initially loaded to the browser. This may not be ideal for earch engines that are trying to index the
content of your pages so people can find you. If you render the initial HTML markup on the server and send
this to the client, this creates a faster initial page load experience because the rendered HTML is smaller
than the JavaScript code of the entire app. React will still be able to recognize your app and manage it after
the initial load.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The renderToString() method is provided on ReactDOMServer, which is a available here as a global object. The
method takes one argument which is a React element. Use this to render App to a string.
