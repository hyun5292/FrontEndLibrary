////Learn How Script Tags and Document Ready Work
Now we're ready to learn jQuery, the most popular JavaScript tool of all time.
Before we can start using jQuery, we need to add somethings to our HTML.
First, add a script element at the top of your page. Be sure to close it on the following line.
Your browser will run any JavaScript inside a script element, including jQuery.
Inside your script element, add this code:
$(document).ready(function() { to your script. Then close it on the following line (still inside
your script element) with: });
We'll learn more about functions later. The important thing to know is that code you put inside
this function will run as soon as your browser has loaded your page.
This is important because without your document ready function, your code may run before your 
HTML is rendered, which would cause bugs.

////Target HTML Elements with Selectors Using jQuery
Now we have a document ready function.
Now let's write our first jQuery statement. All jQuery functions start with a $, usually referred 
to as a dollar sign operator, or as bling.
jQuery often selects an HTML element with a selector, then does something to that element.
For example, let's make all of your button elements bounce. Just add this code inside your document
ready function:
$("button").addClass("animated bounce");
Note that we've already included both the jQuery library and the Animate.css library in the background
so that you can use them in the editor. So you are using jQuery to apply the Animate.css bounce class 
to your button elements.

////Target Elements by Class Using jQuery
You see how we made all of your button elements bounce? We selected them with $("button"), then we 
added some CSS classes to them with .addClass("animated bounce");.
You just used jQuery's .addClass() function, which allows you to add classes to elements.
First, let's target your div elements with the class well by using the $(".well") selector.
Note that, just like with CSS declarations, you type a . before the class's name.
Then use jQuery's .addClass() function to add the classes animated and shake.
For example, you could make all the elements with the class text-primary shake by adding the 
following to your document ready functions.
$(".text-primary").addClass("animated shake");

////Target Elements by id Using jQuery
You can also target elements by their id attributes.
First target your button element with the id target3 by using the $("#target3") selector.
Note that, just like with CSS declarations, you type a # before the id's name.
Then use jQuery's .addClass() function to add the classes animated and fadeOut.
Here's how you'd make the button element with the id target6 fade out:
$("#target6").addClass("animated fadeOut");

////Delete Your jQuery Functions
These animations were cool at first, but now they're getting kind of distracting.
Delete all three of these jQuery functions from your document ready function, but leave your
document ready function itself intact.
