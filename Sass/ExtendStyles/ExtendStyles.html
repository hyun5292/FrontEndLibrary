////Extend One Set of CSS Styles to Another Element
Sass has a feature called extend that makes it easy to borrow the CSS rules from one element and
build upon them in another.
For example, the below block of CSS rules style a .panel class. It has a background-color, height
and border.
.panel {
    background-color: red;
    height: 70px;
    border: 2px solid green;
}
Now you want another panel called .big-panel. It has the same base properties as .panel, but also
needs a width and font-size. It's possible to copy and pasted the initial CSS rules from .panel,
but the code becomes repetitive as you add more types of panels. The extend directive is a simple 
way to reuse the rules written for one element, then add more for another:
.big-panel {
    @extend .panel;
    width: 150px;
    font-size: 2em;
}
The .big-panel will have the same properties as .panel in addition to the new styles.

Make a class .info-important that extends .info and also has a background-color set to magenta.
