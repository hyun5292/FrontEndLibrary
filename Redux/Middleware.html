////Use Middelware to Handle Asynchronous(비동기) Actions
So far these challeges have avoided discussing asynchronous actions, but they are an unavoidable part of
web development. At some point you'll need to call asynchronous endpoints in your Redux app, so how do
you handle these types of requests? Redux provides middleware designed specifically for this purpose,
called Redux Thunk middleware. Here's a brief description how to use this with Redux.

To include Redux Thunk middleware, you pass it as an argument to Redux.applyMiddleware(). This statement
is then provided as a second optional parameter to the createStore() function. Take a look at the code at
the bottom of the editor to see this. Then, to create an asynchronous action, you return a function in
the action creator that takes dispatch as an argument. Within this function, you can dispatch actions and
perform asynchronous requests.

In this example, an asynchronous request is simulated with a setTimeout() call. It's common to dispatch 
an action before initiating any asynchronous behavior so that your application state knows that some data
is being requested (this state could display a loading icon, for instance). Then, once you receive the data,
you dispatch another action which carries the data as a payload along with information that the action is 
completed.

Remember that you're passing dispatch as a parameter to this special action creator. This is what you'll
use to dispatch your actions, you simply pass the action directly to dispatch and the middleware takes
care of the rest.
