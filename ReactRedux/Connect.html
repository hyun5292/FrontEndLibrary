<!--
////Connect Redux to React
Now that you've written both the mapStateToProps() and the mapDispatchToProps() functions,
you can use them to map state and dispatch to the props of one of your React components.
The connect method from React Redux can handle this task. This method takes two optional
arguments, mapStateToProps() and mapDispatchToProps(). They are optional because you may
have a component that only needs access to state but doesn't need to dispatch any actions
or vice versa.

To use this method, pass in the functions as arguments, and immediately call the result 
with your component. This syntax is a little unusual and looks like:

connect(mapStateToProps, mapDispatchToProps)(MyComponent)

Note: If you want to omit(생략) one of the arguments to the connect method, you pass null
in its place.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The code editor has the mapStateToProps() and mapDispatchToProps() functions and a new
React component called Presentational. Connect this component to Redux with the connect
method from the ReactRedux global object, and call it immediately on the Presentational
component. Assign the result to a new const called ConnectedComponent that represents
the connected component. That's it, now you're connected to Redux! Try changing either
of connect's argument to null and observe the test results.
