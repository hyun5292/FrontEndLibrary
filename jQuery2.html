////Change Text Inside an Element Using jQuery
Using jQuery, you can change the text between the start and end tags of an element. You can even
change HTML markup.
jQuery has a function called .html() that lets you add HTML tags and text within an element. Any
content previously within the element will be completely replaced with the content you provide
using this function.
Here's how you would rewrite and emphasize the text of our heading:
$("h3").html("<em>jQuery Playground</em>");
jQuery also has a similar function called .text() that only alters text without adding tags. In other
words, this function will not evalutate any HTML tags passed to it, but it will instead treat it as the
text you want to replace the existing content with.
Change the button with id target4 by emphasizing its text.
View our news article for <em> to learn the difference between <i> and <em> and their uses.
Note that while the <i> tag has traditionally been used to emphasize text, it has since been adopted for
use as a tag for icons. The <em> tag is now widely accepted as the tag for emphasize. Either will work
for this challenge.

////Remove an Element Using jQuery
Now let's remove an HTML element from your page using jQuery.
jQuery has a function called .remove() that will remove an HTML element entirely.
Remove the #target4 element from the page by using the .remove() function.

////Use appendTo to Move Elements with jQuery
Now let's try moving elements from one div to another.
jQuery has a function called appendTo() that allows you to select HTML elements and append them to
another element.
For example, if we wanted to move target4 from our right well to our left well, we would use:
$("#target4").appendTo("#left-well");
Move your target2 element from your left-well to your right-well.

////Clone an Element Using jQuery
In addition to moving elements, you can also copy them from one place to another.
jQuery has a function called clone() that makes a copy of an element.
For example, if we wanted to copy target2 from our left-well to our right-well, we would use:
$("#target2").clone().appendTo("#right-well");
Did you notice this involves sticking two jQuery functions together? This is called function chanining and
it's a convenient way to get things done with jQuery.
Clone your target5 element and append it to your left-well.
