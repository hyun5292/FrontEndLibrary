////Pass Props to a Stateless Functional Component
The previous challenges covered a lot about creating and composing JSX elements, functional components,
and ES6 style class components in React. With this foundation, it's time to look at another feature very
common in React:props. In React, you can pass props or properties, to child components. Say you have an 
App component which renders a child component called Welcome which is a stateless functional component.
You can pass Welcome a user property by writing:

<App>
    <Welcome user='Mark' />
</App>
