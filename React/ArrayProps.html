////Pass an Array as Props
The last challenge demonstrated how to pass information from a parent component to child component as props
or properties. This challenge looks at how arrays can be passed as props. To pass an array to a JSX element,
it must be treated as JavaScript and wrapped in curly braces.

<ParentComponent>
    <ChildComponent color={["green", "blue", "red"]} />
</ParentComponent>

The child component then has access to the array property colors. Array methods such as join() can be used
when accessing the property. const ChildComponent = (props) => <p>{props.colors.join(', ')}</p> This will
join all colors array items into a comma separated string and produce: <p>green, blue, red</p> Later, we
will learn about other common methods to render arrays of data in React.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
There are List and ToDo components in the code editor. When rendering each List from the ToDo component,
pass in a tacks property assigned to an array of to-do tasks, for example ["walk dog", "workout"]. Then
access this tasks array in the List component, showing its value within the p element. Use join(', ') to 
display the props.tasks array in the p element as a comma separated list. Today's list should have at
least 2 tasks and tomorrow's should have at least 3 tasks.
