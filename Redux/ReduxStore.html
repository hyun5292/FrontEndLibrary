////Create a Redux Store
Redux is a state management framework that can be used with a number of different web technologies, 
including React.

In Redux, there is a single state object that's responsible for the entire state of your application.
This means if you had a React app with ten components, and each component has its own local state,
the entire state of your app would be defined by a single state object housed in the Redux store. This
is the first important principle to understand when learning Redux: the Redux store is the single source
of truth when it comes to application state.

This also means that any time any piece of your app wants to update state, it must do so through the
Redux store. The unidirectional data flow makes it easier to track state management in your app.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Redux store is an object which holds and manages application state. There is a method called
createStore() on the Redux object, which you use to create the Redux store. This method takes a reducer
function as a required argument. The reducer function is covered in a later challenge, and is already
defined for you in the code editor. It simply takes state as an argument and returns state.

Declare a store variable and assign it to the createStore() method, passing in the reducer as an argument.

Note: The code in the editor uses ES6 default argument syntax to initialize this state to hold a value of 5.
If you're not familiar with default arguments, you can refer to the ES6 section in the Curriculum which
covers this topic.
