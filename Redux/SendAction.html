////Send Action Data to the Store
By now you've learned how to dispatch actions to the Redux store, but so far these actions have not contained
any information other than a type. You can also send specific data along with your actions. In fact, this is 
very common because actions usually originate from some user interaction and tend to carry some data with them.
The Redux store often needs to know about this data.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
There's a basic notesReducer() and an addNoteText() action creator defined in the code editor. Finish the body
of the addNoteText() function so that it returns an action object. The object should include a type property
with a value of ADD_NOTE, and also a text property set to the note data that's passed into the action creator.
When you call the action creator, you'll pass in specific note information that you can access for the object.

Next, finish writing the switch statement int he notesReducer(). You need to add a case that handles the
addNoteText() actions. This case should be triggered whenever there is an action of type ADD_NOTE and it
should return the text property on the incoming action as the new state.

The action is dispatched at the bottom of the code. Once you're finished, run the code and watch the console.
That's all it takes to send action-specific data to the store and use it when you update store state.
