////Use a Ternary Expression(삼항 표현식) for Conditional Rendering
Before moving on to dynamic rendering techniques, there's one last way to use built-in JavaScript conditionals
to render what you want: the ternary operator. The ternary operator is often utilized as a shortcut for if/else
statements in JavaScript. They're not quite as robust(건장한) as traditional if/else statements, but they are 
very popular among React developers. One reason for this is because of how JSX is complied, if/else statements 
can't be inserted directly into JSX code. You might have noticed this a couple challenes ago - when an if/else
statement was required. Ternary expressions can be an excellent alternative if you want to implement conditional
logic within your JSX. Recall that a ternary operator has three parts, but you can combine several ternary 
expressions together. Here's the basic syntax: 

condition ? expressionIfTrue : expressionIfFalse;

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The code editor has three constants defined within the CheckUserAge component's render() method. They are called
buttonOne, buttonTwo and buttonThree. Each of these is assigned a simple JSX expression representing a button
element. First, initialize the state of CheckUserAge with input and userAge both set to values of an empty string.

Once the component is rendering information to the page, users should have a way to interact with it. Within the
component's return statement, set up a ternary expression that implements the following logic: when the page
first loads, render the submit button, buttonOne, to the page. Then, when a user enters their age and clicks the
button, render a different button based on the age. If a user enters a number less than 18, render buttonThree.
If a user enters a number greater than or equal to 18, render buttonTwo.
