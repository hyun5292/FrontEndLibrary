////Create a Component with Composition
Now we will look at how we can compose multiple React components together. Imagine you are building
an app and have created three components: a Navbar, Dashboard and Footer.

To compose these components together, you could create an App parent component which renders each of
these three components as children. To render a component as a child in a React component, you include
the componenet name written as a custom HTML tag in the JSX. For example, in the render method you could
write:

return (
    <App>
        <Navbar />
        <Dashboard />
        <Footer />
    </App>
)
When React encounters a custom HTML tag that references another component (a component name wrapped in < />
like in this example), it renders the markup for that component in the location of the tag. This should
illustrate the parent/child relationship between the App component and the Navbar, Dashboard and Footer.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In the code editor, there is a simple functional component called ChildComponent and a class component
called ParentComponent. Compose the two together by rendering the ChildComponent wihthin the ParentComponent.
Make sure to close the ChildComponent tag with a forward slash.

Note: ChildComponent is defined with an ES6 arrow function because this is a very common practice when using
React. However, know that this is just a function. If you aren't familiar with the arrow function syntax,
please refer to the JavaScript section.
