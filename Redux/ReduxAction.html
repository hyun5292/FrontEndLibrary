////Define a Redux Action
Since Redux is a state management framework, updating state is one of its core tasks. In Redux,
all state updates are triggered by dispatching actions. An action is simply a JavaScript object
that contains information about an action event that has occurred. The Redux store receives
these action objects, then updates its state accordingly. Sometimes a Redux action also carries
some data. For example, the action carries a username after a user logs in. While the data is
optional, actions must carry a type property that specifies the 'type' of action that occurred.

Think of Redux actions as messengers that deliver information about events happening in your
app to the Redux store. The store then conducts the business of updating state based on the 
action that occurred.

Writing a Redux action is as simple as declaring an object with a type property. Declare an object
action and give it a property type set to the string 'LOGIN'.
