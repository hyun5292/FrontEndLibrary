////Combine Multiple Reducers
When the state of your app begins to grow more complex, it may be tempting to divide state
into multiple pieces. Instead, remember the first principle of Redux: all app state is held
in a single state object in the store. Therefore, Redux provides reducer composition as a 
solution for a complex state model. You define multiple reducers to handle different pieces
of your application's state, then compose these reducers together into one root reducer. The
root reducer is then passed into the Redux createStore() method.

In order to let us combine multiple reducers together, Redux provides the combineRecuers()
method. This method accepts an object as an argument in which you define properties which
associate keys to specific reducer functions. The name you give to the keys will be used
by Redux as the name for the associated piece of state.
